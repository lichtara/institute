# Abstract â€” Harmonic Bio-Resonance (HBR) Multicenter Study

Harmonic Bio-Resonance (HBR) is an emerging consciousness-based therapeutic technology designed to restore systemic coherence by modulating the human bio-energetic field via precisely tuned sound, synchronized visual geometry, and directed intention. This multicenter, longitudinal protocol (five centers, 12 months, n=500) will evaluate the clinical efficacy of HBR on stress, sleep quality, cognitive performance, and emotional regulation. We combine physiological biomarkers (HRV, EEG, GSR, salivary cortisol), fMRI connectivity, and validated psychometrics within the Ethical-Regenerative Paradigm of the Lichtara OS framework. Expected outcomes include significant improvements in psychophysiological well-being and the establishment of a reproducible consciousness-based model for integrative medicine. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, open repositories (Zenodo), and institutional collaborations across the Lichtara OS (Oktave) architecture.
